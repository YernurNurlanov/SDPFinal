# Main body:
## Strategy Pattern

#### Files
- `DefensiveStrategy.java`
- `OffensiveStrategy.java`
- `FootballStrategy.java`

#### Description
The Strategy pattern is employed to enable dynamic changes in the behavior of objects at runtime. It's particularly useful in scenarios where multiple algorithms or strategies might be chosen depending on the context. In TeamPlay Dynamics, this pattern allows teams to switch between different styles of play, such as offensive and defensive.

#### Implementation in Project
- **`FootballStrategy` Interface**: Defines the `play()` method to be implemented by different strategies.
- **`DefensiveStrategy` Class**: Implements the `FootballStrategy` interface, encapsulating the defensive style of play.
- **`OffensiveStrategy` Class**: Implements the same interface, representing an offensive approach to the game.

#### Usage
- Teams or individual players can use these strategies to adapt their gameplay according to various situations on the field.
- By changing the strategy object, teams can shift their playing style seamlessly during a game.

#### Benefit
This pattern provides a high level of flexibility in decision-making processes on the field, enabling teams to alter their tactics based on real-time game dynamics without the need to modify the core team/player classes.

#### Example
- A team's strategy can be set to either `DefensiveStrategy` or `OffensiveStrategy`.
- Calling the `play()` method on the current strategy executes the corresponding behavior (defensive or offensive play).

## Factory Method Pattern

#### Files
- `DefensiveTeam.java`
- `DefensiveTeamFactory.java`
- `OffensiveTeam.java`
- `OffensiveTeamFactory.java`
- `Team.java` (Interface)
- `TeamFactory.java` (Interface)

#### Description
The Factory Method pattern in TeamPlay Dynamics is utilized for creating objects â€” in this case, football teams with specific strategies. This pattern defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to change the type of objects that will be created.

#### Implementation in Project
- **`Team` Interface**: Outlines the basic structure and functionalities of a team.
- **`DefensiveTeam` and `OffensiveTeam` Classes**: Concrete implementations of the `Team` interface, each equipped with a specific playing strategy.
- **`DefensiveTeamFactory` and `OffensiveTeamFactory` Classes**: These classes encapsulate the logic for creating specific types of teams (defensive or offensive) with relevant strategies.

#### Usage
- This pattern allows for the creation of teams with different strategies, such as defensive or offensive, without the client code needing to know the specifics of team creation.
- It provides a flexible framework for managing team creation, making the system easy to extend with new types of teams or strategies.

#### Benefit
The Factory Method pattern enhances the system's scalability and maintainability. It allows for easy introduction of new team types or strategies, adhering to the open/closed principle and ensuring that existing code does not need to be modified to accommodate new features.

#### Example
- When a defensive team is required, `DefensiveTeamFactory` is used to create an instance of `DefensiveTeam` with a defensive playing strategy.
- Similarly, `OffensiveTeamFactory` is used to create `OffensiveTeam` instances for teams that prefer an offensive approach.


## Observer Pattern

#### Files
- `LeagueObserver.java`
- `Observer.java`

#### Description
The Observer pattern is used in TeamPlay Dynamics to establish a one-to-many relationship between the `FootballLeague` (the subject) and various observers. It allows for efficient notification of changes in the league to all subscribed observers, such as league updates.

#### Implementation in Project
- **`Observer` Interface**: Outlines the contract for observers, primarily the `update(String message)` method, which is called when the subject's state changes.
- **`LeagueObserver` Class**: Implements the `Observer` interface and represents an observer in the football league context. It receives and processes notifications from the `FootballLeague`.

#### Usage
- The pattern enables `LeagueObserver` instances to receive real-time updates from the `FootballLeague` whenever a significant event occurs, like the addition of a new team.
- Provides a scalable way to manage notifications to a potentially large number of observers.

#### Benefit
The Observer pattern ensures that changes in the league's state are efficiently propagated to all interested parties (observers). It enhances the maintainability and scalability of the notification mechanism in the league management system.

#### Example
- When the `FootballLeague` adds a new team, it triggers a notification process where all the subscribed `LeagueObserver` instances are informed of this addition through their `update` method.



## Singleton Pattern

#### File
- `FootballLeague.java`

#### Description
The Singleton pattern in TeamPlay Dynamics is exemplified by the `FootballLeague` class. This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It is particularly useful for managing shared resources or coordinating actions across the system.

#### Implementation in Project
- **`FootballLeague` Class**: This class is responsible for managing the football league, including teams and observers.
- **Singleton Nature**: Ensures that there is only one instance of `FootballLeague` throughout the application.
- **Method `getInstance()`**: Guarantees that only one instance of `FootballLeague` is created. If the instance doesn't exist, it is created; if it does, the existing instance is returned.

#### Usage
- `FootballLeague` acts as a central point for managing teams and broadcasting updates to observers.
- Ensures consistent and coordinated handling of league operations, such as adding teams and notifying observers of changes.

#### Benefit
The Singleton pattern is crucial for maintaining a single, consistent state of the league throughout the application. It prevents the complications and errors that could arise from having multiple instances of the league.

#### Example
- To access the league and perform operations like adding a team or an observer, the `FootballLeague.getInstance()` method is used. This ensures all interactions are with the same league instance.
- When a new team is added using `addTeam(Team team)`, all observers are notified through the `notifyObservers(String message)` method, demonstrating the centralized management of the league.



## Decorator Pattern

#### Files
- `PressingDecorator.java`
- `StrategyDecorator.java`

#### Description
The Decorator pattern in TeamPlay Dynamics is used to dynamically add new behaviors to objects without changing their original class. This pattern is particularly effective in enhancing existing strategies with additional characteristics, such as pressing, in a football game context.

#### Implementation in Project
- **`StrategyDecorator` (Abstract Class)**: Implements the `FootballStrategy` interface and contains a reference to a `FootballStrategy` object. This class serves as the base for further extensions.
- **`PressingDecorator` Class**: Extends `StrategyDecorator`, enhancing the base strategy with pressing behavior. It overrides the `play()` method to add "with pressing" to the strategy's action.

#### Usage
- This pattern allows teams to apply additional tactical elements like pressing to their existing strategies without creating entirely new strategy classes.
- It provides a way to combine different aspects of gameplay (e.g., offensive play and pressing) in a flexible and modular manner.

#### Benefit
The Decorator pattern offers a flexible approach to modifying object behavior. It promotes code reusability and helps in maintaining single responsibility in classes by allowing modifications without altering the original class's code.

#### Example
- A football team using an `OffensiveStrategy` can wrap it with `PressingDecorator` to apply an aggressive pressing style while maintaining the underlying offensive approach.
- When the `play()` method is called on the decorated strategy, it executes both the offensive play and pressing behaviors.


## Adapter Pattern

#### Files
- `Team.java`
- `Trainer.java`
- `TrainerHelperAdapter.java`
- `TrainerInterface.java`

#### Description
The Adapter pattern is used to allow two incompatible interfaces to work together. In this case, it allows a `Team` object that operates with methods in Russian to be used by a `Trainer` interface expecting methods in English.

#### Implementation in Project
- **`Team` Class**: Represents a football team with methods `offensiveRussian()` and `defensiveRussian()`, which are in Russian.
- **`Trainer` Interface**: Expects two methods `defensiveEnglish()` and `offensiveEnglish()` to be implemented, representing commands in English.
- **`TrainerHelperAdapter` Class**: This adapter class implements the `TrainerInterface` and translates the English commands into Russian by invoking the corresponding methods on the `Team` class.

#### Usage
- A `Trainer` gives commands in English.
- `TrainerHelperAdapter` translates these commands into Russian.
- The `Team` then executes the commands in its own language (Russian).

#### Benefit
This approach allows the `Team` to be controlled by a `Trainer` interface, regardless of the language difference, making the system flexible and adaptable to different languages and command styles.
