# Main body:

## Strategy Pattern

#### Files
- `ContextStrategy.java`
- `DefensiveStrategy.java`
- `OffensiveStrategy.java`
- `FootballStrategy.java` (Interface)

#### Description
In TeamPlay Dynamics, the Strategy pattern enables the dynamic selection of gameplay strategies. This pattern decouples the strategic decision-making process from the specific strategies, allowing for flexible changes during a game.

#### Implementation in Project
- **`FootballStrategy` Interface**: The core of the strategy pattern, defining the `play()` method.
- **`DefensiveStrategy` and `OffensiveStrategy` Classes**: Concrete implementations of the `FootballStrategy`, each offering a unique approach to playing football.
- **`ContextStrategy` Class**: Manages the current strategy and provides a method to set and execute the chosen strategy.

#### Usage
- Allows a football team to adapt its playing style in real-time, switching between offensive and defensive tactics as the game evolves.
- Enhances flexibility and adaptability on the field.

#### Benefit
The Strategy pattern introduces a significant level of flexibility in tactical decision-making. It allows teams to alter their approach seamlessly without changing the team's core functioning or structure.

#### Example
- The team can adjust its strategy from defensive to offensive or vice versa by simply changing the strategy in the `ContextStrategy` object and then executing the `getStrategy()` method.

## Factory Method Pattern

#### Files
- `DefensiveTeam.java`
- `DefensiveTeamFactory.java`
- `OffensiveTeam.java`
- `OffensiveTeamFactory.java`
- `Team.java` (Interface)
- `TeamFactory.java` (Interface)

#### Description
The Factory Method pattern in TeamPlay Dynamics is crucial for the creation of football teams with distinct strategies. It defines a standard interface for creating objects while allowing for flexibility in the actual objects being created.

#### Implementation in Project
- **`Team` Interface**: Outlines the structure and functionalities expected of a team.
- **`DefensiveTeam` and `OffensiveTeam` Classes**: Concrete implementations of the `Team` interface, tailored for specific playing styles.
- **`DefensiveTeamFactory` and `OffensiveTeamFactory` Classes**: These factories handle the creation of defensive and offensive teams, respectively.

#### Usage
- Facilitates the dynamic creation of teams with specified strategies, keeping the creation process consistent yet customizable.
- Enhances the system's ability to grow and adapt to new types of teams or strategies.

#### Benefit
The Factory Method pattern improves the code's scalability and maintainability by centralizing team creation and allowing for future expansions without significant changes to the existing codebase.

#### Example
- When a specific type of team is required, the corresponding factory (`DefensiveTeamFactory` or `OffensiveTeamFactory`) is used to instantiate it with the desired strategy.



## Observer Pattern

#### Files
- `LeagueObserver.java`
- `Observer.java`
- `FootballLeague.java`(Singleton folder)

#### Description
The Observer pattern is used in TeamPlay Dynamics to establish a one-to-many relationship between the `FootballLeague` (the subject) and various observers. It allows for efficient notification of changes in the league to all subscribed observers, such as league updates.

#### Implementation in Project
- **`Observer` Interface**: Outlines the contract for observers, primarily the `update(String message)` method, which is called when the subject's state changes.
- **`LeagueObserver` Class**: Implements the `Observer` interface and represents an observer in the football league context. It receives and processes notifications from the `FootballLeague`.
- **`FootballLeague` Class**: This class can add, remove, notify observers. And class has observers list.

#### Usage
- The pattern enables `LeagueObserver` instances to receive real-time updates from the `FootballLeague` whenever a significant event occurs, like the addition of a new team.
- Provides a scalable way to manage notifications to a potentially large number of observers.

#### Benefit
The Observer pattern ensures that changes in the league's state are efficiently propagated to all interested parties (observers). It enhances the maintainability and scalability of the notification mechanism in the league management system.

#### Example
- When the `FootballLeague` adds a new team, it triggers a notification process where all the subscribed `LeagueObserver` instances are informed of this addition through their `update` method.

## Singleton Pattern

#### File
- `FootballLeague.java`

#### Description
The Singleton pattern in TeamPlay Dynamics is exemplified by the `FootballLeague` class. This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It is particularly useful for managing shared resources or coordinating actions across the system.

#### Implementation in Project
- **`FootballLeague` Class**: This class is responsible for managing the football league, including teams and observers.
- **Singleton Nature**: Ensures that there is only one instance of `FootballLeague` throughout the application.
- **Method `getInstance()`**: Guarantees that only one instance of `FootballLeague` is created. If the instance doesn't exist, it is created; if it does, the existing instance is returned.

#### Usage
- `FootballLeague` acts as a central point for managing teams and broadcasting updates to observers.
- Ensures consistent and coordinated handling of league operations, such as adding teams and notifying observers of changes.

#### Benefit
The Singleton pattern is crucial for maintaining a single, consistent state of the league throughout the application. It prevents the complications and errors that could arise from having multiple instances of the league.

#### Example
- To access the league and perform operations like adding a team or an observer, the `FootballLeague.getInstance()` method is used. This ensures all interactions are with the same league instance.
- When a new team is added using `addTeam(Team team)`, all observers are notified through the `notifyObservers(String message)` method, demonstrating the centralized management of the league.

## Decorator Pattern

#### Files
- `DefensiveStrategy.java` (Strategy folder)
- `OffensiveStrategy.java` (Strategy folder)
- `FootballStrategy.java` (Interface) (Strategy folder)
- `PressingDecorator.java`
- `StrategyDecorator.java`

#### Description
The Decorator pattern in TeamPlay Dynamics is used to dynamically add new behaviors to objects without changing their original class. This pattern is particularly effective in enhancing existing strategies with additional characteristics, such as pressing, in a football game context.

#### Implementation in Project
- **`FootballStrategy` Interface**: The core of the strategy pattern, defining the `play()` method.
- **`DefensiveStrategy` and `OffensiveStrategy` Classes**: Concrete implementations of the `FootballStrategy`, each offering a unique approach to playing football.
- **`StrategyDecorator` (Abstract Class)**: Implements the `FootballStrategy` interface and contains a reference to a `FootballStrategy` object. This class serves as the base for further extensions.
- **`PressingDecorator` Class**: Extends `StrategyDecorator`, enhancing the base strategy with pressing behavior. It overrides the `play()` method to add "with pressing" to the strategy's action.

#### Usage
- This pattern allows teams to apply additional tactical elements like pressing to their existing strategies without creating entirely new strategy classes.
- It provides a way to combine different aspects of gameplay (e.g., offensive play and pressing) in a flexible and modular manner.

#### Benefit
The Decorator pattern offers a flexible approach to modifying object behavior. It promotes code reusability and helps in maintaining single responsibility in classes by allowing modifications without altering the original class's code.

#### Example
- A football team using an `OffensiveStrategy` can wrap it with `PressingDecorator` to apply an aggressive pressing style while maintaining the underlying offensive approach.
- When the `play()` method is called on the decorated strategy, it executes both the offensive play and pressing behaviors.

## Adapter Pattern

#### Files
- `Team.java`
- `Trainer.java`
- `TrainerHelperAdapter.java`
- `TrainerInterface.java`

#### Description
The Adapter pattern is used to allow two incompatible interfaces to work together. In this case, it allows a `Team` object that operates with methods in Russian to be used by a `Trainer` interface expecting methods in English.

#### Implementation in Project
- **`Team` Class**: Represents a football team with methods `offensiveRussian()` and `defensiveRussian()`, which are in Russian.
- **`Trainer` Interface**: Expects two methods `defensiveEnglish()` and `offensiveEnglish()` to be implemented, representing commands in English.
- **`TrainerHelperAdapter` Class**: This adapter class implements the `TrainerInterface` and translates the English commands into Russian by invoking the corresponding methods on the `Team` class.

#### Usage
- A `Trainer` gives commands in English.
- `TrainerHelperAdapter` translates these commands into Russian.
- The `Team` then executes the commands in its own language (Russian).

#### Benefit
This approach allows the `Team` to be controlled by a `Trainer` interface, regardless of the language difference, making the system flexible and adaptable to different languages and command styles.
